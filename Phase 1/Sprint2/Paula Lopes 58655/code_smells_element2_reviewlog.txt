I agree with the explanation, maybe you could have highlighted the refactoring proposal more, I feel like I understood it in between lines. Good.

I agree with the refactoring proposal. 
However I think there should have been a more indepth explanation of what is considered duplicate code. Good.

I agree that this is a message chain code smell. 
However I think the refactoring proposal should consist on creating a class that let's say stores this objects and has methods that return them aswell,
and the method removeUnwantedCharacters would call an instance of this class. Good.
