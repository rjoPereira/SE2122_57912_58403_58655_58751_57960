1. Paula Lopes - Long Parameter List 

I agree with the identification, explanation and refactoring proposal! The only thing I'd like to highlight is that the code snippet could be bigger.

2. Pedro Reis - Message Chain

I agree both with the identification of the code smell and the explanation; the refactoring proposal is just as good.

3. Rita Silva - Data Class

Even though the identification seems correct, I believe it would have been wiser to explain why you saw this class as such code smell.
