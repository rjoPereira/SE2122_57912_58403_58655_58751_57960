Reviewing Paula's Dependency Metrics

I found your evaluation to be as thorough as necessary; explaining the Dependency parameters really helped to understand the graphs.
It was also brilliant of you to calculate modes and average values and use them as a means to prove your point! 
It really made everything easier.

I hadn't realised how much should be improved only by looking at the dependency issues!

It would have been great if you could have added some more code smells that would support your thesis, especially because we actually saw a couple
of them when going through the code.

Overall, your analysis seems very well elaborated. Congrats!
