Review's of Paula Ines Lopes - Element 2
 
Factory - Done by Clara Sousa [ Element 1 ]
Explanation makes it easy to understand what a factory design pattern does! Well done.

Command - Done by Pedro Reis [ Element 3 ]
What a great explanation, it even proposes how to make it work to its full potential. 

Adapter - Done by Ricardo Pereira [ Element 4 ]
Could have a more indepth explanation of what an adapter design pattern is used for. Good.
