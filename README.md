Software Engineering Project

It is the aim of this project to apply concepts presented in lectures to a bibliographic references manager program, JabRef. 
This project was structured and worked on using the Agile values and principles.

The existing gap between the delivery of sprints-related documents and its real development is a result of the shift in the mindset the S Team suffered. Originally, user stories were being used as a basis for the sprints, since this was what the team learnt by reading Agile literature and discussing it with engineers who use Agile on a daily-basis. After having understood that for this first delivery, tasks such as creating a use case diagram were to be the basis of a sprint, the adequate changes were made to the project.
